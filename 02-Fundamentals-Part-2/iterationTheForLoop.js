LECTURE: Iteration: The for Loop
1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters. 
   Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, 
   by logging a string like this to the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting'
*/

for( let voter = 1; voter <= 50; voter++){
    console.log(`Voter number ${voter} is currently voting`);
